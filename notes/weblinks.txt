SRID - a unique value for representing a spacial coordinate sytem
 - primary key for spatial_ref_sys table 

EPSG - European Petroleum Survey Group - authority originally 
  keeping an index or SRIDs

    The OGPâ€™s EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is a collection of definitions of coordinate reference 
    systems and coordinate transformations which may be global, regional, national or local in application.

Spacial Reference System
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system
	A spatial reference system (SRS) or coordinate reference system (CRS) is a coordinate-based local, 
	regional or global system used to locate geographical entities. A spatial reference system defines 
	a specific map projection, as well as transformations between different spatial reference systems. 
	Spatial reference systems are defined by the OGC's Simple feature access using well-known text, 
	and support has been implemented by several standards-based geographic information systems. 
	Spatial reference systems can be referred to using a SRID integer, including EPSG codes defined 
	by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System
http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/epsg3857-wgs84-web-mercator-auxiliary-sphere/
WGS84 is a standard spherical coordinate system used by the GPS system.
Also called EPSG:4326.

What's the difference between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:900913/EPSG:3857 (Google Projection)?
	Source: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/34276/whats-the-difference-between-epsg4326-and-epsg900913
	http://crschmidt.net/blog/archives/243/google-projection-900913/comment-page-1/

	They are not the same. EPSG:4326 refers to WGS 84 whereas EPSG:900913 refers to WGS84 Web Mercator. 
	EPSG:4326 treats the earth as an ellipsoid while EPSG:900913 treats it as a sphere. This affects 
	calculations done based on treating the map as a flat plane which is why your features got 
	plotted on the wrong places.

	As a point of trivia: 900913 was originally rejected as a credible projection by European Petroleum S
	urvey Group (EPSG) so Google (who invented it for the web) gave it their own number, which if 
	you type it on an old fashioned calculator spells 'google' (substitute '9' for 'g' and squint a bit). 
	Eventually EPSG relented and allowed 900913 into its geodetic repository but gave it the number 3857.
